# Tweet Sentiment Analysis using Logistic Regression

This Python project performs sentiment analysis on tweets using logistic regression. It processes tweets, builds a frequency distribution of words, and then classifies tweets as either positive or negative based on the sentiment conveyed in the text.

## Features
- Tokenizes tweets and removes unnecessary elements like stock market tickers, hashtags, and links.
- Uses stemming to reduce words to their root form.
- Performs sentiment analysis based on a logistic regression model trained on positive and negative tweet datasets.
- Can predict the sentiment of custom tweets.
